Task statement
"IT Infrastructure is comprised by hardware and software. Hardware main categories are server,
switch and router. Software Main categories are OS,  CMS and CRM. Hardware uses software and Software manage hardware "

Knowledge Engineering in First-order logic
1. Identify the task
Classify main components groups within IT infrastructure
Classify main components within each IT infrastructure group

2. Assemble the relevant knowledge:

IT infrastructure has Hardware and Software

Server is Hardware
Hub is Hardware
Router is Hardware
Switch is Hardware


OS is Software
CMS is Software
CRM is Software


Hardware uses Software
Software manage Hardware


3. Decide on vocabulary:
select functions, predicate, and constants

Constant	1, 2, A, John, Mumbai, cat,....
Variables	x, y, z, a, b,....
Predicates	Brother, Father, >,....
Function	sqrt, LeftLegOf, ....
Connectives	∧, ∨, ¬, ⇒, ⇔
Equality	==
Quantifier	∀, ∃

Constants: Server, Hub, Router, Switch, OS, CMS,CRM, ERP
Variables: x, y, z
Predicates:
    IT Infrastructure(Hardware)
    IT Infrastructure(Software)

    Hardware (x)
    Software (y)
Functions:

    IT Infrastructure
        contains(x, Hardware)
        contains(y, Software)
    Hardware
        uses (x, y)
        connects (x,x)
    Software
        manages (y, x)
        connects(y,y)

Encode general knowledge about the domain:

All IT Infrastructure is made of software and hardware.

# All Hardware and Software is IT_Infrastructure
"IT_Infrastructure (Hardware, SoftWare)"

#Hardware Servers, Hub, Router, Switch, Facility  are Hardware, uses Software, connects_via Network
"~Hardware(Software)"
"server(x) -> Hardware(x)"
"hub(x) -> Hardware(x)"
"router(x) -> Hardware(x)"
"switch(x) -> Hardware(x)"

"is (x, server)"
"is (x, Hub)"
"is (x, router)"
"is (x, switch)"

"uses(x, y)"
"Connect (x,x)"

Software OS, CMS, CRM, ERP are Software, manages Hardware, connects_via Network
"OS (y) -> Software(y)"
"CMS(y) -> Software(y)"
"CRM(y) -> Software(y)"
"ERP(y) -> Software(y)"

"manages(y, x)"
"connect (y,y)"

5. Encode a description of the problem instance:

For IT Infrastructure = Hardware, Software
For Hardware = Server, Hub, Router, Switch
For Software = OS, CMS, CRM, ERP

6. Pose queries to the inference procedure and get answers:
