What is the purpose of the CMDB,	The purpose of a CMDB is to provide accurate and reliable information about digital services and the infrastructure that supports them
What type of information does a CMDB contain ,	CMDB stores information that describes components—“things” —in your operational environment that are involved in the delivery of digital services. Each component is represented as a configuration item (CI).
What is a CI,	"CI has multiple attributes that contain specific information about the component the CI represents. CI classes are arranged in a class hierarchy, with each subclass extending the attributes of its parent class."
How does it represent the delivery of digital services,	CIs also have relationships. For instance, an application can run on a server, or a web server can depend on an upstream load balancer. The CMDB stores these relationships between CIs, along with the relationship type (depends on, runs on, etc.).
Are all Cis the same type,	CIs can be broadly grouped into two main categories—infrastructure CIs and service Cis
What is an infrastructure CI,	Infrastructure CIs represent capabilities provided by physical or logical components such as servers, routers, application software, cloud resources, and so on 
What is a service CI,Service CIs represent digital services and are supported by infrastructure CIs. In ServiceNow, there are three types of service CIs, representing business, application, and technical services.
What is a business service,A business service supports a business capability—such as managing customer orders—and is consumed by business users. Business services are typically underpinned by one or more application services (i.e. a business service can include multiple applications).
What is a technical service,A technical service is a technical capability that underpins one or more application services. For instance, multiple application services—including the stock inventory system above—could all use a common storage service.
What is an application service,An application service is a full application stack—for example, a stock inventory system that supports the customer order management business service described above. It isn’t just the application—it’s all the distributed components that make the application work. This is what we typically think about when we talk about a digital service.
Is a CI the same as an asset, CIs and assets are related, but they’re not the same. For instance, consider a physical server that you have purchased. This is tagged and recorded as an
asset. Once the server becomes operational, a CI record is created in the CMDB to represent the operational capability provided by the server. The CI —not the asset record—is then referenced in incidents, change requests, and so on. CIs can also exist without corresponding assets—for example, a cloud-based server is represented in the CMDB as a CI, but there is no corresponding asset record since the server does not physically exist.
What is Linux, Linux is an operating system, which was released in 1991. The Linux OS runs on almost every server on the Internet. Linux is both the central module that is responsible for the basic features of the system and the name of a family of operating systems that includes between 500 and 600 OS for different tasks.
What are facilities, Facilities or physical plants provide space for networking hardware, servers and data centers. It also includes the network cabling in office buildings to connect components of an IT infrastructure together.
What are network elements, Networks are comprised of switches, routers, hubs and servers. Switches connect network devices on local area networks (LAN) like routers, servers and other switches. Routers allow devices on different LANs to communicate and move packets between networks. Hubs connect multiple networking devices to act as a single component.
What is a Server, A core hardware component needed for an enterprise IT infrastructure is a server. Servers are essentially computers that allow multiple users to access and share resources
What is a data center, Organizations house multiple servers in rooms called server rooms or data centers. Data centers are the core of most networks.
What is CMS, CMS stands for Content management systems. A content management system is for creating, managing, and optimizing your customers' digital experience. More specifically, a CMS is a software application that allows users to collaborate in the creation, editing, and production of digital content: web pages, blog posts, etc
What is CRM, CRM stands for Customer relationship management. It's a technology used to manage interactions with customers and potential customers
What is ERP, ERP stands for Enterprise resource planning. Is a type of software system that helps organizations automate and manage core business processes for optimal performance.
What is Windows, Windows is the name of a computer operating system, which was developed by Microsoft and introduced in 1985. The system is available in more than 100 languages and is used by millions of people worldwide, being the world’s most popular operating system for personal computers.
